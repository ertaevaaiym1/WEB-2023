    <h1>I love my country</h1>
    <p>
        I love my country, my Kazakhstan,<br>

    Its beautiful nature and its golden Sun.<br>

    I love its steppes and the blue sky.<br>

    I'm its daughter that is why.<br>

    We live in peace with different nations<br>

    We have many friends all over the world.<br>

    We are the future generation<br>

    We are responsible for the World.<br>
